This code was originally generated with assistance from the OpenAI chatbot GPT-3, but has since been heavily modified by me to better fit the needs of my case use and significant troubleshooting and re-rewriting to make it actually work.

If you use this code in a project or video I would love to hear about it! This of course is not required but I'm super curious and would love to learn about other people's projects.
